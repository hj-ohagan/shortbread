# shortbread problem
### Toy problem given in my first company:
You are given a file with a list of English words seperated by '/n', starting from the word "short", find a sequence of words that end in the word 'bread' by changing one letter at a time such that the word is still a valid word. 
E.g: (short -> shoot -> shoat) etc... is a valid sequence.
