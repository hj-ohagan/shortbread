# shortbread problem
### Toy problem given by my first company:
You are given a file with a list of English words seperated by '/n', starting from the word "short", find a sequence of words that end in the word 'bread' by changing one letter at a time such that the word is still a valid word. 

E.g: (short -> shoot -> shoat) etc... is a valid sequence.

After getting a valid path, what about shortest path? What optimisations can be done?

This repo contains my initial solution written in 2016 as a fledgling software developer as well as my latest solution after coming back to the problem.
